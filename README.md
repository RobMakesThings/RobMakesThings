### Howdy! ðŸ¤ 



I'm a multifaceted creator based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, seamlessly blending the worlds of technology and art. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science focused on Cybersecurity from Colorado Technical University, I offer a unique perspective that bridges IT and creative fields.

My professional journey includes technical support and sales strategy implementation at T-Mobile, as well as deep dives into cybersecurity and digital forensics. I'm proficient in languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I thrive on tackling new technological challenges.

As an artist, I explore the intersection of data and human experience, finding beauty in both natural forms and complex machinery. My work as a VJ at venues like Effex and The El Rey Theater showcases my ability to create immersive visual experiences. I use a variety of open-source software to push the boundaries of digital art.

Lately, I've been captivated by plotter art, using drawing robots to transform digital concepts into physical form. This fusion of technology and creativity mirrors my approach to both art and professional workâ€”innovating, learning, and solving problems.

I'm passionate about opportunities that allow me to leverage both my technical expertise and creative vision. Whether you're seeking an innovative IT professional or a tech-savvy artist, I'm eager to bring my skills to your project or team.

I have a wide variety of interests. Here you can find some projects Ive worked on.
